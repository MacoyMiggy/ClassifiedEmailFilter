This is a simple console application implemented in C#. This example assumes that we have access to the incoming email text and that you have a list of keywords or patterns that might indicate classified information.

Brief Explanation for this Source Code:

This code defines a ClassifiedMailFilter class with two main methods: IsClassifiedEmail and CensorSensitiveText. 
The IsClassifiedEmail method checks if the email contains any of the predefined classified keywords. 
If it finds any, it returns true, indicating that the email might be classified. 
The CensorSensitiveText method replaces the sensitive text (keywords) with asterisks (*) of the same length.

In the Main method, you can replace the emailText variable with the actual text of the incoming email. 
If the filter detects potential classified content, it prints the censored version of the email text to the console. 
Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that no potential classified email was detected.
